# shareyourvoice
A super simple Android app that uses Bravobit's FFmpeg-Android to create videos from audios
## How to use
Simply select an image/audio file from your device and let the app do the rest for you. This app uses FFmpeg's loop option to "convert" the image file to an video file and append the audio file to it.

## Warning
- Due to Android restrictions (not providing a URI translation tool), **you _must_ open the "Hamburger" menu, then select "Internal Storage/Device name" or "SD card/Secondary Storage"**. Doing the opposite will result in **app crash**.
- Due to a bug in Android 10, this app has to lower the targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion from 30 to 28, so it has to run in compability mode for devices running Android 10.
- **This app is still a little buggy and I'm constantly adding new features so any contribution to the app is welcomed.**
